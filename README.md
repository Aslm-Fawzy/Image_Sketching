# Image Sketching
## Idea :
 The idea is to build an computer vision app that will take an normal image/photo as input from the user and convert it into a pencil sketching using oprn CV library.

## Steps :
1. Reading Image
2. Resizing Image
3. Converting Image to Gray-Scale Image
4. Apply Bitwise-Not for Image
5. Smoothing and Removing Noise for Image using Gaussian Filter
6. Divide Gray-Scale by Inverse of Smoothed Image to Get Sketch Image
