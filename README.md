# Image Sketching
### Idea :
> The idea is to build an app that will take an normal image/photo as input from the user and convert it into a pencil sketching .

## Steps :
1. Reading Image
2. Resizing Image
3. Converting Image to Gray-Scale Image
4. Apply Bitwise-Not for Image
5. Smoothing and Removing Noise for Image using Gaussian Filter
6. Divide Gray-Scale by Inverse of Smoothed Image to Get Sketch Image
